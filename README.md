# odin-landing-page

In this project for [the Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com), I created a website "landing page". I followed [this design image](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/81a5d553f4073e593d23a6ab00d50eef8620796d/foundations/html_css/project/imgs/01.png) and using [these colors and font styles](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/81a5d553f4073e593d23a6ab00d50eef8620796d/foundations/html_css/project/imgs/02.png), both provided as part of the task outline.

It put the Flexbox skills I'd learned earlier in the day to the test, and I'm quite happy with the result. I found it helpful to refer to earlier exercises in the curriculum at times, and the Odin Project Discord channel definitely held the answer for at least one query of mine.

If I was to improve further on this, I would put a bit more effort into organising my CSS file. At the very least, different sections could be formed by commented headers. Rules could then be grouped by the section of the webpage that they apply to. 

Of course, some creative flair would also be welcome.
